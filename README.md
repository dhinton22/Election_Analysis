# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Challenge Overview and Summary
I was challenged with ensuring the syntax for Python was correct. I greatly relied on Visual Studio Code to prevent syntax errors. 

## Election-Audit Summary
- This code can be modified to analyze broader regions. For example:
    - You can modify the code from counties to states. This modification could greatly assist in analyzing the data on a nation-wide scale versus a state-wide scale. 
    - You can modify the code to analyze votes in a school elections by changing the counties to grade levels.
